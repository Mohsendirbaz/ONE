# API Package Initialization

## Overview
The `api/__init__.py` file serves as the initialization module for the API package in the backend application.

## Purpose
This module marks the `api` directory as a Python package, allowing other modules to import API-related components.

## Module Structure
```python
# API package initialization
"""
This package contains API endpoint handlers for the application.
"""
```

## Package Contents
The API package is designed to contain:
- API endpoint handlers
- Route definitions
- Request/response processing logic
- API-specific utilities

## Usage
This initialization file enables importing from the api package:
```python
from api import endpoint_module
from api.handlers import specific_handler
```

## Integration
- Part of the backend application structure
- Works with Flask or other web frameworks
- Provides centralized location for API logic

## Notes
- Currently a minimal initialization file
- Can be extended to include package-level imports or configuration
- Follows Python package conventions
