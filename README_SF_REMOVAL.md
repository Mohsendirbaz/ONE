# SF Directory Removal

## Background
The SF directory has been marked for removal from this repository. This directory appears to contain development or experimental code that is no longer needed.

## Current Status
Attempts to remove the SF directory during the cleanup process were unsuccessful because some files in the directory are locked by another process. The following steps have been taken:

1. The SF directory entry has been removed from the `.gitignore` file
2. Multiple attempts to remove the directory using various methods have failed due to locked files

## How to Complete the Removal
To complete the removal of the SF directory:

1. Close all applications that might be using files in the SF directory
2. Run the `remove_sf_later.bat` batch file included in the repository
3. Verify that the SF directory has been successfully removed
4. Commit the changes to the repository

## Alternative Method
If the batch file doesn't work, you can manually remove the SF directory using these steps:

1. Close all applications that might be using files in the SF directory
2. Open a command prompt with administrator privileges
3. Navigate to the repository root directory
4. Run the command: `rd /s /q SF`
5. Verify that the SF directory has been successfully removed
6. Commit the changes to the repository

## Verification
After removing the SF directory, you should verify that:
- The SF directory no longer exists in the repository
- The application still builds and runs correctly
- All tests pass

If you encounter any issues after removing the SF directory, please refer to the repository history or contact the repository maintainers.
