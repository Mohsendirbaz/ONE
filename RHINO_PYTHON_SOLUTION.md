# Rhino Python Packages Solution

## Issue Summary

The issue was related to installing the following Rhino Python packages:
- `rhinoscriptsyntax`
- `scriptcontext`
- `Rhino`

These packages are used in the `test_entity_analyzer.py` script but are not available through standard pip installation. When attempting to install them using pip, the following error was encountered:

```
ERROR: No matching distribution found for scriptcontext
```

## Solution

The solution involves understanding that these packages are not standard Python packages available on PyPI. They are part of the Rhino3D software installation and are designed to be used within Rhino's Python environment.
