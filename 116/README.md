# Reduced Codebase (1/16th Size)

This directory contains a reduced version of the original codebase, where each file has been reduced to approximately 1/16th of its original size while attempting to maintain the essence of the file.

## How the Reduction Was Done

The reduction was performed using a Python script (`reduce_codebase.py`) that:

1. Traverses all files and directories in the project recursively
2. For each file, reduces the content to approximately 1/16th of its original size
3. Maintains the essence of each file by:
   - Keeping the first few lines (imports, headers, etc.)
   - Selecting lines evenly distributed throughout the file
4. Saves the reduced files with "116" suffix in the "116" directory with the same relative path structure

## Limitations

The reduced files have several limitations:

1. **Loss of Context**: The reduced files often contain fragments of code without proper context, making it difficult to understand the full functionality.
2. **Broken Syntax**: The reduced files may have broken syntax as the reduction process doesn't consider the syntax of the language.
3. **Incomplete Functions/Classes**: Functions and classes may be incomplete, with only parts of their definitions included.
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Some dependencies may be missing if they were not included in the selected lines.

## Purpose

This reduced codebase is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project structure and the types of files and functionality it contains. It is not intended to be a functional codebase.

## Original Codebase

The original codebase is located in the parent directory. For a complete understanding of the project, please refer to the original files.
