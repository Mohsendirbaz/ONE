## Overview

The Climate Module is a core component of the TEA Space platform, providing comprehensive capabilities for emissions tracking, regulatory compliance monitoring, and geospatial analysis. The module enables users to:

- Track carbon emissions across multiple geographic zones
- Monitor compliance with regulatory frameworks at local, state, and federal levels
- Analyze emissions patterns using advanced clustering algorithms
- Generate and manage different types of geographic zones
- Evaluate the impact of hard-to-decarbonize sectors

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Climate Module's architecture, functionality, and integration points, with a specific focus on the regulatory aspects of emissions tracking and the proposed Authority Tracing Module.

## Zone Management System

### Zone Generation

The Climate Module includes a sophisticated zone generation system that supports creating different types of geographic zones:

- **Square Zones**: Regular grid-based square zones
- **Hexagonal Zones**: Hexagonal grid zones for more natural geographic representation
- **Circular Zones**: Circular zones with configurable radii

Zones can be generated programmatically using the `generateZoneGrid` function:

```javascript
const zoneConfig = {
  gridSize: { rows: 3, columns: 3 },
  zoneSize: { width: 1, height: 1, unit: 'km' },
  zoneShape: 'square',
  namingPattern: 'Zone-{x}-{y}',
  nameStartIndex: 1
};

const centerPoint = { longitude: -122.4194, latitude: 37.7749 }; // San Francisco
const zones = generateZoneGrid(zoneConfig, centerPoint);
```

### GeoJSON Integration

The system supports importing zone definitions from GeoJSON files, allowing for integration with external GIS systems:

```javascript
const geoJSONData = '...'; // GeoJSON data as string
const zones = parseGeoJSONToZones(geoJSONData);
```

### Zone Clustering

The Climate Module includes a powerful zone clustering system that uses k-means clustering to group zones based on various attributes:

- **Emissions-based clustering**: Groups zones with similar emissions profiles
- **Regulatory-based clustering**: Groups zones with similar compliance statuses
- **Combined clustering**: Groups zones based on both emissions and compliance

```javascript
const clusters = createZoneClusters(
  zones,
  'emissions', // Analysis type: 'emissions', 'regulatory', or 'combined'
  3, // Number of clusters
  carbonFootprints,
  complianceStatus
);
```

## Emissions Tracking Framework

### Multi-dimensional Carbon Tracking

The Climate Module tracks carbon emissions across multiple dimensions:

- **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources
- **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling
- **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions in a company's value chain

### Hard-to-Decarbonize Sectors

Special tracking is provided for hard-to-decarbonize sectors:

- Energy
- Steel
- Cement
- Chemicals
- Transportation
- Agriculture

### Emission Factors

The system includes configurable emission factors for different cost components:

- Equipment Cost: 2.5 kg CO₂e per unit
- Installation: 1.2 kg CO₂e per unit
- Material: 3.8 kg CO₂e per unit
- Energy: 4.5 kg CO₂e per unit
- Transportation: 5.2 kg CO₂e per unit
- Labor: 0.8 kg CO₂e per unit
- Maintenance: 1.0 kg CO₂e per unit
- Disposal: 2.0 kg CO₂e per unit

## Regulatory Compliance System

### Three-Tier Compliance Framework

The Climate Module implements a three-tier compliance framework that monitors emissions against regulatory thresholds at different governmental levels:

- **Local (Municipal)**: City or county level regulations
- **State (Regional)**: State or provincial level regulations
- **Federal (National)**: National level regulations

Each tier has configurable thresholds and can be independently enabled or disabled.

### Compliance Status Monitoring

The system automatically calculates compliance status based on emissions levels:

- **Compliant**: Emissions below the regulatory threshold
- **Warning**: Emissions approaching the regulatory threshold
- **Non-compliant**: Emissions exceeding the regulatory threshold

### Regional Systems Support

The Climate Module supports different regional systems:

- **SI System**: Uses metric units (kg CO₂e)
- **Field System**: Uses imperial units (lb CO₂e)

## Authority Tracing Module

### Purpose and Functionality

The proposed Authority Tracing Module will enhance the Climate Module by providing detailed tracking of regulatory authorities and their jurisdictions. This will help determine the final compliance status in different geographic zones, with specific support for both European and American regulatory systems.

### European Regulatory System

The European regulatory system is characterized by:

- **EU-level Directives**: Overarching frameworks like the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)
- **National Implementation**: Country-specific implementation of EU directives
- **Regional Authorities**: Sub-national authorities with specific enforcement powers

### American Regulatory System

The American regulatory system is characterized by:

- **Federal Regulations**: EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act
- **State Implementation Plans**: State-level implementation and enforcement
- **Local Ordinances**: City and county level regulations that may exceed federal or state requirements

### Authority Hierarchy Mapping

The Authority Tracing Module will map the hierarchy of regulatory authorities for each zone:

```javascript
const authorityHierarchy = {
  EU: {
    level: 'supranational',
    authorities: ['European Commission', 'European Environment Agency'],
    regulations: ['EU ETS', 'Effort Sharing Regulation'],
    subordinates: ['Germany', 'France', 'Italy', /* other EU countries */]
  },
  US: {
    level: 'federal',
    authorities: ['EPA', 'Department of Energy'],
    regulations: ['Clean Air Act', 'CAFE Standards'],
    subordinates: ['California', 'Texas', 'New York', /* other states */]
  },
  California: {
    level: 'state',
    authorities: ['CARB', 'CEC'],
    regulations: ['AB 32', 'Low Carbon Fuel Standard'],
    subordinates: ['Los Angeles', 'San Francisco', /* other cities */]
  }
  // Additional authorities...
};
```

### Jurisdiction Determination

The module will determine which authorities have jurisdiction over a specific zone based on:

- Geographic location
- Emission types and volumes
- Industry sector
- Facility size and capacity

### Compliance Determination Process

The Authority Tracing Module will implement a multi-step process to determine compliance:

1. Identify all authorities with jurisdiction over a zone
2. Retrieve applicable regulations for each authority
3. Calculate compliance status for each regulation
4. Resolve conflicts between different regulatory levels
5. Determine final compliance status

## Mixture Model for Regulatory Uncertainty

### Handling Fuzzy Situations

In cases where regulatory jurisdiction or compliance status is uncertain, the Climate Module will implement a probability-based mixture model to infer the final status.

### Bayesian Network Approach

The proposed mixture model will use a Bayesian network to represent the probabilistic relationships between:

- Geographic location
- Regulatory authorities
- Emission types and volumes
- Historical compliance patterns
- Industry sector characteristics

### Probability Distribution

For each zone, the model will calculate a probability distribution over possible compliance statuses:

```javascript
const complianceDistribution = {
  compliant: 0.65,
  warning: 0.25,
  'non-compliant': 0.10
};
```

### Confidence Scoring

The model will provide confidence scores for its determinations:

- **High confidence**: Clear regulatory jurisdiction and requirements
- **Medium confidence**: Some regulatory overlap or ambiguity
- **Low confidence**: Significant regulatory uncertainty or conflicting requirements

### Decision Support

The mixture model will provide decision support by:

- Identifying the most likely compliance status
- Quantifying uncertainty in the determination
- Suggesting actions to reduce regulatory uncertainty
- Highlighting potential regulatory conflicts

## Integration with TEA Space Platform

### Component Integration

The Climate Module integrates with other TEA Space components:

- **Financial Modeling Engine**: Incorporates carbon costs into financial projections
- **Parameter Management System**: Treats emissions parameters as elements in the 5-dimensional space
- **Visualization Framework**: Provides interactive visualizations of emissions and compliance data

### Data Flow

The Climate Module exchanges data with other system components:

1. Receives cost and scaling data from the Financial Modeling Engine
2. Calculates emissions based on cost components and emission factors
3. Determines compliance status based on emissions and regulatory thresholds
4. Returns emissions and compliance data to the visualization framework
