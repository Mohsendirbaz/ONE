# Data Package Initialization

## Overview
The `data/__init__.py` file serves as the initialization module for the data package in the backend application.

## Purpose
This module marks the `data` directory as a Python package, enabling organized data management and operations.

## Module Structure
```python
# Data package initialization
"""
This package contains data-centric files and operations.
"""
```

## Package Contents
The data package is designed to contain:
- Data processing modules
- Data models and schemas
- Database interaction layers
- Data transformation utilities
- File management operations (e.g., `sensitivity_file_manager.py`)

## Current Components
Based on the project structure, this package includes:
- `sensitivity_file_manager.py` - Manages sensitivity analysis data files

## Usage
This initialization file enables importing from the data package:
```python
from data import sensitivity_file_manager
from data.models import DataModel
```

## Integration
- Central location for data-related operations
- Separates data logic from business logic
- Provides consistent interface for data access

## Future Extensions
This package can be extended to include:
- Data validation modules
- Cache management
- Data serialization/deserialization
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations

## Notes
- Follows separation of concerns principle
- Keeps data operations isolated from other system components
- Facilitates testing and maintenance of data-related code
